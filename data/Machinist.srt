1
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,500
Who are you?

2
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,300
Jesus.

3
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,200
You ok?

4
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,200
Do I look ok?

5
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,500
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist

6
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,150
No...

7
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,050
Trevor...

8
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,700
You still got half an hour.

9
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,500
I can fix you some eggs.

10
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,050
I am tired but thanks.

11
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Let's go, monkeys.
Watch your work, not your ass.

12
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,950
Come on guys, keep it moving.

13
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,200
Yes sir, yes sir,
Master Tucker, motherfucker

14
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Hey, why is that machine down!

15
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,000
- I am cleaning this.
- It takes 7 minutes to power up that mill

16
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Where am I going to make up
that 7 minutes? Miller?

17
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,700
Your paycheck?

18
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,900
-Back off Tucker, you don't sketch regulations.
-What regulations?

19
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Lock out devices must be in place during cleaning
and maintenance of all heavy machineries, (motion 1989)

20
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,200
Ya! Write to your congressman and hurry that up.

21
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,450
Congratulations, Reznik.
You just made my shitlist.

22
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,065
And he's like, you know, babe this babe that...
Chatting like mother fucking Barry White.

23
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,365
Talking about what he is going to do to her,
and how to make her Cucci feel and all that.

24
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:48,760
That is right.

25
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,900
So then, she stopped

26
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,800
She looked back at him with these
big puppy eyes she's like...

27
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,165
That sounds good puppy,
but me no have no Cucci

28
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,200
So, my man said, what?!
He looked down and realised that SHE IS A HE!

29
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,600
Man, that's bullshit!

30
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,160
You meant to tell me that this whore was wearing nothing
but a thong and this fool can't tell no difference.

31
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,500
Hey, man. he had one of those "tuck jobs".
Come on Jones, you know how to do that.

32
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,550
You might, I don't!

33
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:16,830
Yeah, whatever.

34
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,185
You Reznik, you wanna go for some cards tonight?

35
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,365
Can't, got plans.

36
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,400
Shit! See, this nigger say the same thing every poker night.
Hey, what is up with you? you used to be alright.

37
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,850
Well, he used to hang but he ain't never been alright.

38
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,300
Hey, Jackson, you need to realise that
some men prefer the company of women.

39
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:36,500
Who! hotty duty, he ain't get no booty.

40
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,430
Maybe he has got a date by the name "tuck jobs"

41
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,025
No, your mother said she couldn't make it.

42
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,600
Oh! Reznik talking smack,
I can't even respond to that.

43
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,600
You ok?

44
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,400
Do I look ok?

45
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,950
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.

46
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,300
What's wrong?

47
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,050
I don't know, deja vu.

48
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,650
You are tired, you need to sleep.

49
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,550
How do you do it?

50
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,300
What?

51
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,050
Sleep so little and still look so good.

52
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you flirting with me?

53
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,850
Commiserating

54
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,300
-Try to fatten me up?
-What if I am?

55
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Suppose I wanted blueberry.

56
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,200
You had that last night.

57
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,550
You don't fool me, Trevor Reznik.
I have you figured out.

58
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,100
- You do, huh?
- Muhmmm

59
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,550
What else do you know about me?

60
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,500
That you are lonely.

61
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,850
When you work here as long as I have,
you get to know the type.

62
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:24,100
Hey, everyone gets lonely, Trevor.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.

63
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,400
How can I be lonely,
when I have you to keep me company?

64
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,100
Check please

65
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,200
You, Reznik, Furman's office. Now!

66
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,400
How are you doing, Reznik?

67
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
What is this about?

68
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,800
Frankly I am concerned about you.

69
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,200
To be honest, I think you look like toasted shit.

70
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,550
I felt a lot on my mind lately.

71
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,000
-Anything we can help with?
-No, thanks. There's nothing I can't handle.

72
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,100
- Wanna see a doctor?
- It is not necessary, I am fine really.

73
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,950
Are you doing drugs Reznik?

74
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,050
Where is Stewart?

75
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
He couldn't make it

76
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,200
- Shouldn't even be in here with an union ()
- See what I mean.

77
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,200
Look, Trevor, I understand how you feel, but believe me,
there is absolutely nothing to worry about

78
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,900
Then I will just get back to work

79
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,300
Er... Trevor, not yet.

80
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,400
I need to ask you for a UA

81
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,150
Look like rain.

82
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
Radio says there is a storm on the way.

83
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,600
they said right.

84
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,300
I'd say it's already here.

85
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,400
You are on the first shift?

86
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,200
- Yeah
- Me too

87
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,050
Funny I never seen you before.

88
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
I've been here.

89
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,050
I work in the pit
I just picked up Reynolds's shift.

90
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,150
Where is Reynolds?

91
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,800
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.

92
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,350
I am Ivan.

93
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,150
Trevor

94
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,900
Well, I guess I'd better begin by...

95
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,700
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.

96
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,500
You got that right.

97
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,300
I will see you around.

98
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,850
what is wrong?

99
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,900
I just want to lie here.

100
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,100
We can do that.

101
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm... so... tired

102
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,500
You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter.

103
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,950
That is the problem. I can't sleep.

104
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,200
Nothing helps.

105
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,500
Don't worry about it honey.

106
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,100
Everyone get insomnia every now and then.

107
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,200
Stevie

108
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,400
I haven't slept in a year.

109
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,500
Jesus Christ!

110
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,900
I tried him too...

111
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
I am sorry.

112
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Hello?

113
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,850
Yeah. No I can't.
I can't talk now. Okay.

114
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,200
My ex, he's a fucking Psycho.

115
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
Trevor, I am worried about you.

116
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,400
Don't worry, no one ever died of insomnia.

117
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,300
I hope not, you are my best client.
Can't afford to lose ya.

118
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Geee... thanks

119
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,400
Reznik, I need a hand

120
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,800
Gotta get this dead level here, help me out

121
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
- Safety on?
- Oh Yeah

122
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,900
How is that?

123
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,200
A little to the left.

124
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,550
Do I need more?

125
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,150
Hey, you sleep on your own time, need some help here.

126
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,200
Better, now try the other side.

127
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,150
I hate this bitch.

128
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,800
Hey! what did you do?

129
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,500
I am hooked up here.
Kill it, will ya?

130
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,000
-Come on, kill it.
-Not working.

131
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,850
Damn it! Reznik!
Shit!

132
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,600
- Kill it!
- Not working

133
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,400
God! Jesus!

134
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,850
- Hit the breaker!
- What?

135
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,550
Hit the breaker!

136
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,850
Hey, hey, hey!
We some help over here!

137
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,800
We need some help

138
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
- Come on man, come on.
- What's happening here, man?

139
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,600
Call an ambulance!

140
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,100
What happened here?

141
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,400
I was helping him with the belt.
I thought the safety was on.

142
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,400
You thought?!

143
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,500
Somebody kill that fucking machine!

144
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Shit!

145
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,850
Hello, Mrs. Shrike. I come to give you the rent.

146
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,400
And so early. Oh Mr Reznik, I only wish
all my tenants are considerate as you.

147
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,100
I will give you a receipt in the morning

148
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,600
Good night mr. Reznik.

149
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,550
Err... Mrs. Shrike, Forgive me

150
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,500
but... if you noticed anyone
hanging around my apartment?

151
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,200
- Has there been a burglary?
- No, no, no, I just wondered if...

152
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,400
You know errr... if you noticed anything unusual lately?

153
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,100
Unusual?

154
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,400
Ah, never mind, Mrs. Shrike.

155
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,950
I am sorry... to disturb you so late.
Good night.

156
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,200
What we know is this:

157
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,700
One: Miller was operating the mill in long sleeves.

158
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,300
Two: Miller's arm was in the cutting zone
of mill while it was off.

159
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,350
Three: the mill suddenly activates,

160
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,500
catching Miller's sleeve, resulting in this.

161
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,100
What is the fucking point?

162
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,150
These accidents are never pretty, Mr. Reznik.

163
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,550
Our job is to investigate these events
from every possible angles...

164
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,000
So that we might prevent their reoccurrence.

165
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,100
So we'd appreciate it if you are a bit more co-operative.

166
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,400
I knocked into the fucking activator by mistake.

167
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,700
What caused the mistake, Mr. Reznik?

168
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,050
I was distracted.

169
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,400
By what?
What distracted you?

170
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,600
It was Ivan,
I was watching Ivan on the pit.

171
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,250
The whole thing is my fault, okay.

172
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,650
Who did you say?

173
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,650
The new arcwelder,
I don't know his last name.

174
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,000
- What new arcwelder?
- Ivan, the guy from the swing shift.

175
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,350
Reynolds was picked up on a warrant
This guy got his place.

176
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,450
What the fuck are you talking about, Reznik?

177
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,850
Reynolds is right over there
on the pit as usual, busting his ass.

178
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,600
There is no Ivan in National Machine, Reznik.

179
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,200
What is this?

180
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,300
Mr. Reznik
Have you recently suffered any head injuries?

181
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,750
Ever hear of pumpkin pie?

182
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,100
No

183
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,850
-Trevor
-Yeah

184
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,150
Can I ask you a question?
Sure

185
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,100
Why do you go all of your way
to come here every night?

186
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Is it all the way?

187
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,500
An airport? For coffee and pie?

188
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,200
Suppose I went to Danni's...

189
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,650
Suddenly I get an overwhelming urge to skip town.

190
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,250
Could I do that just in any diner?

191
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,500
Is someone chasing you?

192
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,850
Not yet. But they will
when they find out who I am.

193
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,050
Oh really! Who are you?

194
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,350
Can you keep a secret?

195
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,150
To the grave.

196
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
I am Elvis Presley.

197
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,350
I ran away from home
to pursue my blue-collar aspirations.

198
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,850
I thought you looked familiar.

199
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,200
Got plans for mother's day?

200
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,200
I am taking my little boy to the amusement park.

201
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,550
Suppose to be my day and he gets all the fun.

202
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,900
That is ok, when he is older

203
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,750
I will let him make it up to me.

204
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,250
A little guilt goes a long way.

205
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,650
How about you?

206
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,300
Cemetery

207
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,400
- Oh, I am sorry
- Thanks

208
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,600
I lost mine too. Still hurts.

209
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,350
I am not so good at losing family.

210
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,300
Who is?

211
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,900
What's weird is that it did not hit
until I picked out her burial dress.

212
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,350
I pictured her while buying it...

213
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,150
...Not knowing it would...

214
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,100
You know, be the one.

215
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,400
Seems unfair, isn't it?

216
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,300
Not knowing things like that

217
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Hey, how about spending the day
with me and Nicolas after the cemetery?

218
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,000
Sounds dreamy

219
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,500
Hey Reynolds, what did the Feds want you for?

220
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,700
Armed robbery.

221
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,450
Oh yeah, that is right, because I and Jackson
had you packed and pantified... ain't that right, Jackson?

222
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,500
HEY, I don't see what is so fucking funny.

223
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,600
You clowns think this's fucking like some big joke
but it ain't!

224
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you.

225
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,500
You made me nervous.

226
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,500
You look like shit, acting all crazy.
What is up with you?

227
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Nothing is up with me.

228
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
It was an accident and I am the one
who gotta live with it, not you.

229
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,200
You ain't hearing me, man.

230
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,950
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody.

231
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
See you tomorrow.

232
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,550
Hey

233
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,350
Howdy, partner.

234
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,400
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.

235
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,400
- What about?
- I don't know, but it seemed important.

236
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,600
What! He's ganna have to wait,
it is Miller time.

237
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,300
We need to talk.

238
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:51,900
Follow me.

239
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,350
Come on!

240
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,700
Another Bourbon.

241
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,050
Make it double.

242
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,750
You shooting coke or something?

243
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,150
You look like a dope fiend to me.
No offence.

244
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,620
I don't use drugs.
I mean I don't even drink.

245
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,200
How about abnormally?

246
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,600
I see Reynolds is back to work.

247
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,200
Gets to me bail

248
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,400
I will tell you one thing,
If I dig, You are showing carbon to it.

249
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,800
Would you? never trust a con, cowboy!

250
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,600
They ain't get to live to be honest.

251
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,400
Where they hiding you these days?

252
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,100
Around

253
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,050
Hey, you wanna see something?

254
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,140
Look at that. Lost them on a lake.

255
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,300
They took a big toe from the left foot
and a finger from my right.

256
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,800
That is why I walk with a gimp.

257
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Yeah, I can't shuffle my cock like I used to
but the ladies sure like it.

258
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,600
Oh, no. You look like you have seen a ghost.

259
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Funny you should say that.
The guys from work don't think you exist.

260
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,600
- That is why I can't get a raise.
- According to Tucker, you are not even on the payroll.

261
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,300
You believe that?

262
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,600
- Why would they lie?
- They just have a little bit of fun with you.

263
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,950
I am not laughing.

264
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,600
Quit fucking around, a guy lost his arm.
He could have died.

265
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,150
That ain't my problem.

266
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,600
You caused the accident, not me.

267
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,450
Where are you going?

268
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Take a leak, you wanna watch?

269
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,100
I will be right back, don't just bail me now.

270
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,200
- Hello?
- Hey Reynolds, it's Trevor.

271
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,050
What time is it?

272
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,300
How are they biting Reynolds?

273
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:39,500
- You, you are drunk, Reznik.
- The game's over. I got proof on you.

274
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,350
I could use it.

275
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,150
You better watch your fucking ass buddy,
before you lose it.

276
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,450
Trevor?

277
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,850
I need to see you, Stevie.

278
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,385
- Well, Jesus, Trevor, I am not exactly alone here.
- Please, Stevie.

279
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:59,150
- I think I am falling apart.
- Can you come back in an hour?

280
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,170
No, no, no, no, I need to see you now.

281
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,100
In case of something happens,
I need someone to know.

282
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,200
Ok, give me a minute.

283
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,500
I appreciate you making time for me,
you are the only one I can talk to.

284
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,350
My pleasure.

285
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,980
Most guys don't come here for my conversation.

286
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,850
Something is happening to me, Stevie.

287
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,100
Some kind of... plot.

288
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,900
There was an accident at the shop.
A man was nearly killed thanks to me.

289
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,050
- Oh, my god!
- Now the guys at work are against me.

290
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,200
They want me out and I don't blame them.
Just the way they're going about it...

291
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,300
Their eyes, their little games.

292
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,300
What?

293
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,150
E R.. E R..

294
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,700
-T U C K E R
-Trevor?

295
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,600
TUCKER?

296
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,100
Maybe err you take this accident thing a bit too hard.

297
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,100
I mean...

298
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,100
If they wanted you out,
they could just fire you.

299
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,700
I am not worried about being fired.

300
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,400
Then what are you worried about?

301
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,650
I don't know yet.

302
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,550
There you go, made to order.

303
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:52,200
- Thanks.
- Surprise!

304
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,050
Got ya! That one's going on the fridge.

305
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,520
Here, let me get one of you and Nicolas.

306
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,750
By the carousel.

307
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Just a minute.

308
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,100
Okay, ready.

309
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,450
Smile!

310
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,350
It helps if you push the button.

311
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,600
Trevor? What is it?

312
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,400
- This place, brings back memories.
- Good memories I hope.

313
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,650
Yeah, I haven't been here since I was a kid.

314
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,100
My ex, probably phone
to ruin a happy Mother's Day

315
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,550
Could you...?

316
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,700
- Yes, no sweat. I will take Nicolas for a ride.
- Thanks.

317
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,900
How long have you known my mother?

318
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,950
About a year.

319
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,750
How did you meet her?

320
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,750
We just kind of met.

321
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,650
Are you going to see her again?

322
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,950
I hope so.

323
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,700
Would you like that?

324
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,850
I guess so

325
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,450
Hey, you wanna know a secret?

326
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,850
What?

327
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,600
My father left us when I was your age.
You wanna know something else?

328
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,500
Made me realised what a wonderful mother I had.

329
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,100
You will realise that too some day.

330
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
What is that?

331
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,550
Monster ride.

332
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,350
Route six hundred and sixty six.
What does that mean?

333
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Well, a route is a road you take
when you're on a long journey.

334
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,600
Can we go in?

335
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,400
Well, Nicolas, maybe we should wait for your mother.

336
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,600
What for?

337
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,600
You are going straight
to hell on route 666.

338
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:14,300
Ride here if you dare!
You are going straight to hell on route 666.

339
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,800
Look like someone had a bad crack up.

340
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,500
Fill her up, cowboy.

341
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,850
We wouldn't be eating in there
anytime soon, Nicolas?

342
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,500
Eww.. look at that.

343
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,600
You should close your eyes.

344
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,100
Jesus!

345
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,300
- Boy, this is one heck of a ride.
- Yeah.

346
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,050
Shady Lady

347
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,060
Oh, my God.

348
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,500
Stop!

349
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,600
Woo

350
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,500
Take a right, Nicolas!
Right, a right!

351
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Nicolas, Nicolas!
Hey, Nicolas!

352
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,250
I need some help here.

353
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,050
Okay, somebody gets a doctor.

354
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,400
Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help.

355
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,450
Nicolas!

356
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,600
I swear to God, I don't know what happened.

357
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,900
He is epileptic.
I should have told you.

358
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,100
- I will call an ambulance.
- No, thanks.

359
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,800
It is ok, baby.

360
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,600
It hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.

361
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,400
I could have killed myself
for taking him on that ride.

362
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,200
It's ok, it's not your fault.

363
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,200
He won't even remember it,
as if nothing ever happened.

364
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,200
Wanna come in?

365
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,700
I think you could use a drink.

366
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,500
I hope wine is okay with you.

367
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,100
That'll work.

368
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,600
What good is it at home
if you can't relax in it.

369
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,100
I will have to remember that.

370
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,450
Trevor? Can I ask you something?

371
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,650
Should my lawyer be present?

372
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,900
Why are you always leaving such generous tips?

373
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,285
- Do I?
- 20 dollars for coffee and pie?

374
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,100
And entertainment.

375
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,250
- Entertainment?
- You.

376
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,650
Trevor, you don't have to buy my companionship.

377
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,050
Sorry, I wasn't meant that way.

378
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,100
If you really wanna spoil me,
take me to a movie sometime.

379
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,400
Hmmm?

380
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,200
That is a deal.

381
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,700
My goodness, there must be a hole in this glass.

382
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,900
I will get it.

383
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,150
-You wait on me.
-Thanks

384
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,900
It is the last door on the left.

385
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,750
Reznik

386
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,700
I want you on the Swansea-leave today.

387
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:37,200
- Where is Sanchez?
- That is an irrelevant question, Reznik, I'm asking you.

388
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,030
Shit!

389
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,300
- If there's anything else we can do for you, let us know.
- Thank you, Mr Furman.

390
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,500
Bye. See you now.

391
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,120
Hey, look who it is.
Bombay Miller, you ok?

392
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,950
- Good, good.
- You be easy now.

393
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,180
Yeah, man, take it easy.

394
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,400
My God, Miller.
I don't know where to begin.

395
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,300
Nah, don't sweat it, kid.
There is nothing to say.

396
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,100
I wish there is someway I can repay you.

397
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,300
Well, for a start, you can give me your left arm.

398
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,230
In fact, that is why I came
by here today. Isn't it, Tucker?

399
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,500
Fair is fair

400
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,600
We are just razzing you, kid

401
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,650
You keep your left arm,
I will keep my settlement.

402
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,700
Hell! How can a guy lost an arm
end up like getting a deal like this?

403
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,300
So, I guess you can call me lucky.

404
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,050
Well, Miller,
if there is anything I can do...

405
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,700
Nah, forget it.
No hard feelings, huh.

406
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,750
I will see you around, pal.

407
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,400
Ah!

408
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,200
Hey!

409
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,300
Help!

410
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,150
Hey!

411
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,450
Hey!

412
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:03,300
Someone help me!
Someone help me!

413
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,250
Reznik

414
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,300
Ah...

415
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,250
I got ya, I got ya.

416
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,200
Be cool, be cool, alright?

417
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,300
Who did it, huh?

418
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,300
Why did you turn the fucking braker!

419
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,300
Was it all of you?

420
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,500
Was it you, Jones?

421
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,350
Was it you? Was it you?

422
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,600
Or was it you?

423
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,550
You sick bastard,
you're imagining things again!

424
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,650
Oh yeah? You've been fishing
with Ivan lately, Reynolds?

425
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,700
How's that... How's that tuna biting?
Let's see how you talk yourself out of this one!

426
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,200
Where is it?

427
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,350
Right, what the fuck now, Reznik!

428
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,900
Get him off me!

429
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,500
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.

430
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,850
You are fired.

431
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,950
This motherfucker's crazy.

432
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,800
You lost it, man.

433
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:43,950
Shit!

434
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,800
Damn it! Where is it?

435
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,650
Asshole!

436
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,950
What the fuck did you do with it?

437
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:10,400
Idiot!

438
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,150
Hey! Fuck you!

439
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,550
Get out!

440
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,500
What?

441
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,050
It's an occupational hazard.

442
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:24,050
So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from
this miserable life or what?

443
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,100
I could give it up for the right guy.

444
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,150
Oh, that came out wrong.

445
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,600
What I mean is...

446
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:53,200
I would, you know,
stop hooking if you wanted me to.

447
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,850
I mean, there are lots of
pancakes out there, right?

448
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,600
I think I'd like that.

449
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,950
Mr. Reznik.

450
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,530
I am sorry, I thought it was somebody else.

451
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:32,100
You leave me in such a scare.

452
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,750
What are you doing in my apartment?

453
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:40,300
There is a leak in my ceiling.
It's coming from your apartment.

454
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,900
That's impossible.

455
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,700
I'm gonna leave a note.

456
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,100
A note? What kind of note?

457
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:47,950
About the leak.

458
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,100
What's that terrible smell?

459
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,050
There is no leak in this apartment.

460
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,200
Now if you would excuse me...

461
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,900
You're sure you're alright, Mr. Reznik?

462
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,700
Yeah, I'm sure. If you need anything,
please call first.

463
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,600
Miller!

464
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,100
Hey, Reznik.

465
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,600
It's a pleasant surprise.

466
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,600
We need to talk.

467
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,750
Take a look at this, huh?

468
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,700
Picked it up at Grossens, top of the line.

469
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,300
Let's not trim anyting for a while.

470
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,300
I need to be doing something.

471
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,300
Can't just watch the soap opera all day.

472
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,800
That hydro will be here tomorrow.
You won't. Listen to the doctor.

473
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,700
Margie, this is Reznik.
The man who cost me my arm.

474
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,980
How do you do, Mrs. Miller?

475
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,030
I've been better, Mr. Reznik.

476
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,600
Is there some place we can talk?

477
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,800
Check it out.
It's a beauty.

478
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,800
8 cylinders

479
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,900
Speed sensitive steering

480
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,400
ABS breaking with road texure and tension

481
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,300
Defence lock-up helps you
maintain control in emergencies.

482
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,800
Of course, it's automatic.

483
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,000
Hell I wanted a stick...

484
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,300
but I figured my shifting ability
wouldn't be so hot.

485
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,800
You know I am not at
National any more, right?

486
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,200
Yeah, I heard about it.

487
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,350
It sounds like you almost
lost one yourself, huh?

488
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,600
Did you find that a bit ironic, Miller?

489
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Ironic?

490
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,050
I'm sorry kid, I never got over sixth grade.

491
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,600
I'll break it down for you, Miller.

492
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,300
Moments after you left the shop,

493
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,200
someone powered up my machine.

494
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,050
With my arm in it.

495
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,850
I nearly got killed.

496
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,200
Accidents happen.

497
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,200
It wasn't an accident.

498
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,900
Accidents happen out of negligence

499
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,800
This happened down the spike.

500
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,400
That's some vocabulary you got kid.

501
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,300
Spike.

502
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,100
It wields vengeance,
vengeance means revenge Miller.

503
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,800
I am sure you know
what revenge means, don't you?

504
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,100
I am onto you Miller.

505
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,300
Despite your stupid jokes,
you secretly balme me for the accident.

506
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,900
New car, huh? You despise me for it.

507
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,200
How did you get into my place?

508
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,800
Duplicate keys? credit card? What?

509
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,700
Fuck you, Miller!

510
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,900
This shit is gonna stop!

511
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,600
Get off my property, punk!

512
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,800
Bastards.

513
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:17,800
Shit.

514
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,350
Come on.

515
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,700
7-4...

516
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,300
...3-C-R

517
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,800
It's 743CR.

518
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,300
What?

519
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,750
Shit.

520
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,400
Fuck!

521
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,200
I'm sorry sir, but we don't provide...

522
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,800
...motor's information to the general public.

523
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,100
I'm not just a memeber of the general public.

524
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,800
This guy is a friend of mine.

525
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,800
But you don't know your firend's address?

526
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,600
We just met, I don't know him that well.

527
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,300
Sir, this is the DMV, not the dating service.

528
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,100
I just want talk to him.

529
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,900
I'm sorry sir, I can't help you
unless a crime has been committed.

530
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:05,900
Has a crime been committed?

531
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:11,200
Please, I wouldn't ask
if it weren't extremly important.

532
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
Sorry sir. No crime, no information.

533
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,600
What if I told you I was hit by this car?

534
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,900
I don't see any bruises.

535
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,700
If you did,
would you give me an address?

536
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,400
No, but the police might.

537
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,500
I want to report a hit and run.

538
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,950
Bring it back when you are finished.
Fill it out over there.

539
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,900
Mr. Reznik.

540
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,900
You sure about these plate numbers?

541
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,600
743CR. All right, that's the one.

542
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,700
Do you ever have a car stolen?

543
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,800
No, what?

544
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,800
Cause the car that
allegedly hit you was your own.

545
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:26,800
1969, red pontiac viper
registered to your name.

546
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,600
Nearly a year ago you reported it
as being totally wrecked.

547
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,700
Do you know it is a felony
to file a bogus police report?

548
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,200
Hey, wait a minute.
You got some explaining to do.

549
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,100
Hey! Hey!

550
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,300
Jesus, Reznik. Just wanna talk to you.

551
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,200
Hey come back. Reznik, Reznik!

552
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,400
Trevor?

553
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,200
Oh, no.

554
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,700
Trevor, what do you want?

555
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,500
Trevor, it's okay.

556
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,800
Oh God, what happend?

557
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,100
I was crossing the street.
Lights changed on me.

558
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,800
Did he stop?

559
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,200
No, he just kept going.

560
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,300
He fucking hit my drivers man.

561
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,700
He gotta be hanged.

562
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,400
It was my fault.

563
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,600
I wasn't paying attention.

564
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,300
Trevor, we got get you to a hospital.

565
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,100
You may have some internal injuries.

566
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,700
it is just bruises.

567
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,500
Okay, you see this?

568
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,300
This is a bruise,
and this is a train wreck, alright?

569
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,200
What is it with you and doctors?
Don't you trust anyone?

570
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,200
I trust you.

571
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,700
Now I know.
You are crazy.

572
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,700
Can I stay here tonight?

573
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,600
Babe, you can stay here every night.

574
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:07,100
You know that?

575
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,300
What?

576
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,300
What,Babe,
what's going on in that crazy head of yours?

577
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,700
I really want this to work, Stevie

578
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,200
But?

579
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,300
You know so little about me.

580
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,300
What if I turned into a warewolf or something?

581
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,200
I will buy you a flea collar.

582
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,100
I love you.

583
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:51,900
Stevie

584
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,800
Yeah.

585
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,300
Thanks.

586
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:12,900
I set out some clean cloth for you,
your stuff is not dry yet.

587
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,400
You always keep men's cloth lying around?

588
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,100
Some of my regulars.
They like to keep their clean change cloth here.

589
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,800
I probably just throw
them out now, alright?

590
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,100
Hey, perfect fit.

591
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,200
Yeah, whatever Trevor.

592
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,950
I don't have a size 26 waist here.

593
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,600
Hey, how about that idea.

594
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,150
I can get a job selling man's wear.

595
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,700
Those chicks got paid vacations too.

596
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,900
I'll settle for that.

597
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,800
That's not a bad life.

598
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,100
Could be worse.
You know whatelse I want to do?

599
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:51,600
I want to clean up this place,
just get rid of all the fucking junk.

600
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,000
Probably look like I'm a terrible housekeeper,
which I sometimes am...

601
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,500
...but I can also be very very,
you know, organised and neat.

602
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,200
And I wanna do more of that.

603
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,100
I would love to paint a place.

604
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:08,400
Just make it nice, just be organised,
and neat and paint it white.

605
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,500
What I would also like is a decent stove.
This one is covered in fat.

606
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000
()Just like a white, beautiful place
and a decent stove.

607
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,600
Not a lot to ask.

608
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,700
Wow, don't look so surprised.
A call girl scrambling eggs...

609
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,100
Yeah that's funny,
I dont think I ever cooked for a guy before.

610
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,200
Not even my husband.

611
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,100
Jesus Christ.

612
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,300
Where is he?

613
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,100
Who?

614
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,200
You know who.

615
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,800
- Trevor.
- Don't.

616
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,100
Jesus, Trevor, what's wrong?

617
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:25,100
This, Ivan.

618
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,800
He's your ex, isn't he?

619
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:28,800
What?

620
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,200
Why is he doing this?

621
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,700
Just becuase i'm fucking you, isn't it?

622
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:34,900
Now it all makes sense.

623
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,800
I'm fucking you, so he's fucking me.

624
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,600
Where is he?

625
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,700
Hiding in the closet, beneath the bed?

626
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,800
I don't know what you are talking about, babe.

627
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,800
Ah, don't babe me.

628
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,400
Yeah, babe.

629
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,200
I'll change my whole fucking life for you.
I'll do anything you want, babe.

630
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,050
You know what, I don't deserve this.

631
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,150
What did you do?

632
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,800
- Hey!
- Slip this from my wallet from me while proposing to me?

633
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,700
Fuck you!

634
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,600
- You left it in my tip jar the other night.
- Bullshit.

635
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,700
- I thought you wanted me to have it.
- Cut the crap, Stevie.

636
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:14,100
- What is a big deal about a goddamn picture?
- They said that the guy in the photo doesn't exsit.

637
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:19,000
- This says he does.
- Trevor, I don't understand what the fuck you are talking about.

638
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,600
I'm talking about your ex!

639
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:21,800
Ivan.

640
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:28,200
- Who? This guy standing next to you with a fish?
- I'm not in that photo.

641
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,300
Trevor, I'm looking at a picture of you.

642
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,000
You are stading next to some fat guy
with glasses holding a fish.

643
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,900
That's not me.

644
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:55,100
Trevor, it's you.
Look.

645
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,300
You lying whore.

646
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,800
You get the fuck out.

647
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,500
Fucking freak.

648
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,300
You are a fucking pig

649
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,500
You fucking whore

650
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,200
You are a fucking freak.

651
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,900
You are a fucking psycho.

652
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:40,300
Fucking psycho

653
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,900
Where is Marie?

654
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,100
Who?

655
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,000
You know who.

656
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Marie my waitress.

657
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,600
My! You are chatty tonight.

658
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,600
Darling, I am your waitress!

659
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,400
What's going on here?

660
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,100
I've never seen you before.

661
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,200
What are you talking about?

662
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:35,200
You come here every night, stay on that same stool, staring at your coffee.

663
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,200
Honest, I am starting to think that you are mute.

664
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,800
I wanna see Marie!

665
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,800
Mister, there is no Marie that works here.

666
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:54,600
Is everybody at it?

667
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:59,600
Let's have a laugh on Trevor.

668
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,500
Whatever Ivan was paying you is wasting his money.

669
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,200
Go home, Mister.

670
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:11,200
Get some sleep.

671
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:38,100
How could you!

672
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,600
You have to pay your utility bill, partner

673
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:04,400
You know how difficult it is to shave in the dark.

674
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:09,400
What have you done with Nicholas?

675
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:15,100
What have I done with Nicholas?

676
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:24,800
He can't hear you now, pal.

677
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Oh, come on what know what you is dead. heya

678
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,000
You going to do something with that faulty memory of yours. Pal

679
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,200
Might make life a little bit easier.

680
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:48,200
by the way, I just loved them no chilly myself

681
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,000
That one on the refrigerator just kills me.

682
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:03,400
Where is your hospitality, partner?

683
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:13,700
If some had walked in, he might get the wrong idea.

684
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,800
Who are you?

685
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,200
Oh hell, look like you got
some explaining to do, partner.

686
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:28,300
I know who you are.

687
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,300
You going some where, Mr. Reznik?

688
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,300
Yeah, Mrs. shrike, I'm moving.

689
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,300
I didn't receive notice.

690
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,800
Your lease requires you
to get 30 days notice in writing.

691
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,200
It wasn't planned,
something came up.

692
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:53,500
You can keep my security deposite.
I won't be needing it anyway.

693
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:01,300
Really? Mr. Reznik.
You used to be such a good tenant.

694
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,100
I just don't understand it.

695
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:17,950
Oh, isn't that pretty?

696
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,500
Would you care to sell it?

697
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,200
No, it was my mother's.

698
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:34,900
I made all arrangements. Don't move my things.
A truck will be coming by this afternoon.

699
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:35,900
You just want to get away...

700
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,400
If you are going to give it away...

701
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:43,400
Mrs. Shrike, If you'll excuse me.

702
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,500
I like to report a hit-and-run.

703
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,800
Some one will record your statement.

704
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:04,200
Later, right now I just want to sleep.

705
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,100
Just want to sleep.
